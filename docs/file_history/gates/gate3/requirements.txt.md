## Current State
Before repair: dependency manifest allows a Dependabot-reported vulnerable Werkzeug version; Logbook also excludes patched Pillow13.

## Known Issues
Full manifest resolution and platform-specific packaging validation pending. Keep unrelated pins and source unchanged.

## Future Work
Validate minimal security dependency bumps in isolation; retain proof gaps rather than dismiss alerts.

## Entry Log
- 2026-10-30: Created before editing for Trevor's critter health repair. Raise Werkzeug to3.1.9 for GHSA-g6x2-hccm-hh4m; Logbook Pillow to>=13.0.0,<14 for seven current image-parser/encoder advisories. Both support configured Python3.11+. No runtime/release deployment intended by source edit. Recovery: revert this manifest change and rebuild only if necessary, understanding old versions restore known vulnerabilities.

- 2026-10-30 compatibility repair: Full resolver exposed existing pyOpenSSL26.3.0/cryptography50.0.0 conflict. Raise pyOpenSSL to26.4.0, matching already-resolvable Logbook/Client pins, so the patched environment can be built without downgrading cryptography.

- 2026-10-30 candidate verification: Isolated Werkzeug3.1.9/Flask3.1.3 reject Windows NUL:/CON:/aux:/NUL.txt:; normal file download and traversal404 controls pass. Pillow13.0.0 decodes JPEG/PNG/WebP/BMP/TIFF, exif-transposes/converts/thumbnails/savesJPEG; malformed Image.merge first-band and TIFF predictor fail safely. pip check passes in focused environment. Full manifest dry-run resolution passes; Gate2/Gate3 cross-platform wheel resolution used Windows Python3.12, Lite Python3.11. No installer or live web image rebuilt; this is a source dependency repair, not a claim installed clients have upgraded. Existing Windows/Mac pyOpenSSL26.3/cryptography50 conflict repaired with26.4. GitHub advisory closure pending default-branch processing.

- 2026-10-30 native check: Disposable copy of source158 scheduler image Python3.11 installed Werkzeug3.1.9, Pillow13.0.0 and Flask3.1.3 only under /tmp/validated. Imports, PNG/EXIF/thumbnail/JPEG and Windows-device rejection controls passed. Container automatically removed; no live environment packages changed.
